# Official source code of VS FNaF 3.
Mod is running on a modified Psych Engine 0.6.2 version.
Source released to comply with the open source requirement.

## About ports
Please refrain from doing unofficial mod folder ports for at least 2 months. Doing it for private use is totally fine, but wait a bit with the public.
Regarding HTML ports, message @AutisticLulu on Discord if you want to help with making an official HTML build, I have the resources to host the game as a website on my server as well.

Android Build and Linux build is currently in the works by me.

## Pull requests
Feel free to improve upon the code, do a pull request and it might just get merged if it works better than the current source.
