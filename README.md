# Official source code of VS FNaF 3.

Mod is running on a modified Psych Engine 0.6.2 version.
Source released to comply with the open source requirement 

(PORTS OF VS FNAF 3 ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO BE OPENSOURCED, SINCE PEOPLE APPARENTLY DONT UNDERSTAND THIS, I WILL SADLY HAVE TO TAKE MEASURES AGAINST THOSE WHO DON'T RELEASE THEIR PORTS SOURCE)

## Pull requests
